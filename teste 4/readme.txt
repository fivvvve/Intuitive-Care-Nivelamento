This test consists of creating a Vue frontend and a Python backend that communicate with each other. The frontend sends requests to the backend, which searches through the given operators' CSV file and returns the best response.
If you want to download the files and run the frontend and backend on your machine, simply follow the instructions in each directory's README. Otherwise, you can access the deployment link below to see how the application works.
